# Fluxes for a spinning secondary moving on a circular orbit about a Kerr black hole

The files in this directory contain the absolute value of the linear-in-spin corrections to the fluxes for different values of r/M, normalized to q^2, with
q the mass ratio. All fluxes corrections are negative throughout the range of r considered
All of the data is in the format: r  flux_corr

This data comes from Gabriel Andres Piovano, Andrea Maselli and Paolo Pani, [arXiv:2004.02654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02654)
