This directory contains flux data for a particle on a circular orbit about a Kerr black hole. The flux data for |a| <= 0.9 was provided by Scott Hughes. These fluxes were calculated for [Phys. Rev. D 90, 084025 (2014)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.084025), [arXiv:1404.1819](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1819) so please cite this work if you make use of the data.

There is also flux data for very high spin values. These are parameterized by eps = 1-a/M. If you use this data please cite [Class. Quant. Grav. 33 155002 (2016)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/33/15/155002/meta), [arXiv:1603.01221](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01221).

In all the data files the format is: r0/M   Edot_inf   Edot_horiz
