# Circular Orbit Self-Force Data

This repository contains useful flux and self-force data for a particle on a circular orbit about a Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole. The flux data for |a| <= 0.9 was provided by Scott Hughes. These fluxes were calculated for [Phys. Rev. D 90, 084025 (2014)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.084025), [arXiv:1404.1819](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1819) so please cite this work if you make use of the data.

There is also flux data for very high spin values. These are parameterized by eps = 1-a/M. If you use this data please cite [Class. Quant. Grav. 33 155002 (2016)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/33/15/155002/meta), [arXiv:1603.01221](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01221).

The repository also contains local self-force invariants, such as Detweiler's redshift invariant and spin and tidal invariants. Each data file for these invariants contains information on the work to cite if you use the data.

If you use the data in this repository, in addition to citing the relevant work, we also suggest the following acknowledgement: "This work made use of data hosted as part of the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit at bhptoolkit.org."
