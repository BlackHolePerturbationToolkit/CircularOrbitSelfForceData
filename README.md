# Circular Orbit Self-Force Data

This repository contains useful flux and self-force data for a particle on a circular orbit about a Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole. The flux data was provided by Scott Hughes. These fluxes were calculated for [Phys. Rev. D 90, 084025 (2014)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.084025), [arXiv:1404.1819](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1819) so please cite this work if you make use of the data.

The repository also contains local self-force invariants, such as Detweiler's redshift invariant and spin and tidal invariants. Each data file for these invariants contains information on the work to cite if you use the data.
